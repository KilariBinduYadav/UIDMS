# Unique ID Management System Project

This project is developed using Bootstrap and NodeJS. 

UIDMS is a project which generates unique ID for every user who login into the system. This unique ID can be used to perform various operations like banking transactions, book flight tickets and many more.

The advantage of unique ID is all citizens of India can have just one unique ID which can be used to perform any transaction.
